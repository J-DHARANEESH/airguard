# airguard

problem:
Cities around the world are grappling with rising pollution levels and seeking ways tomitigate environmental impact. A key challenge is the integration of smart, real-time machinelearning predictions to enhance the effectiveness of existing environmental solutions.Create innovative machine learning solutions that utilize real-time data to reduce urbanpollution and maximize the effectiveness of current environmental initiatives. Emphasize theuse of smart, real-time ML predictions to tackle environmental challenges.

proposal:
This project presents an integrated approach to urban air quality management,utilizing real-time machine learning (ML) and dynamic resource allocation. TheML model predicts air quality, allowing proactive interventions. The Real-TimeAdaptive Graph (RAG) ensures efficient monitoring by adapting to evolving datapatterns. The code encompasses data preprocessing, model training, and django framework is used for immediate predictions. Furthermore, language translation throughLarge Language Models (LLM) enhances public awareness by delivering insightsin a language comprehensible to the general public, fostering a greaterunderstanding of environmental dynamics and encouraging communityengagement for a sustainable urban environment.
